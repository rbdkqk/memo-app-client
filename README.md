## 진행상황

- (1005)

  - create-react-app 을 활용함. 사용될 모듈들을 설치하였음. 필요없어 보이는 파일들을 제거했음.
  - 2-3) (webpack css-loader 와 style-loader 설치 및 적용) 부분 : 일단 무시했음
  - (public/index.html) Materializecss 적용을 시도함. 잘 된 상황인지 모르겠음.
  - (public/index.html) jQuery 적용을 시도함. 잘 된 상황인지 모르겠음.
  - 이상 내용들을 챙겨서 git 저장소에 올림 (https://github.com/rbdkqk/memo-app-client.git)

- (1006)
  - 구현 완료 : 회원가입/로그인/로그아웃/로그인확인(세션유지)
  - 보완해야 할 점
    - redux 이해가 많이 부족함. (connect 등)
    - 전반적인 구조가 익숙해져야 한다.
    - Materialize 의 toast 가 제대로 작동하지 않는 것 같음.
    - 로그인 유지에 관한 세션/쿠기 부분의 이해가 부족함.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
